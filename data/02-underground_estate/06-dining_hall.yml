description: >
   You are now standing...in a hall of horror.  Littered all around
   are corpses of dwarfs and humans.  Some lay on tables with cut marks
   on their bodies.  Some are fresh and still leak blood. You turn your
   head away from this horror to any possible exits you can find. To the
   north is a small corridor.  To the west lies a small room which appears
   to be a spiral staircase, and to the east remains the rest of this
   great hall of horror.
exits:
   "north": 2-03
   "east": 2-08
   "west": 2-10
