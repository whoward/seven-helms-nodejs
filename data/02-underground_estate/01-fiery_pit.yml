name: Bridge above the Fiery Pit
description: >
   You're standing on a smooth stone bridge crossing the chasm above they fiery pit.  Far above you all you can see is
   the dark starless night, you can attempt to ascend the pit walls to reach your encampment once again.  Examining the
   bridge you find one end abruptly ends a the side of a cliff wall with what was once a stairway along the cliff edge
   descending to this bridge.  The other end of this bridge ends at an elaborate doorjam with stone statues flanking
   both sides.  Beyond the jam is a small room with two adjoining hallways.
