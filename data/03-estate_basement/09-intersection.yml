description: >
   This area is yet another intersection.  This particular intersection 
   splits four ways.  To the north is a long tunnel.  To the east is a
   small room which you can't identify from this distance.  To the south
   is a large open room which seems to be a chasm. The western exit leads
   down a long hallway.
