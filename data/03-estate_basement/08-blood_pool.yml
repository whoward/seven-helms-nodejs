description: >
   You are now standing a room on the far side of the underwater blood pool
   tunnel.  The room seems relatively plain, made of smooth stone bricks 
   with the blood resevoir cut into the middle of the floor in a circular
   tear shape.  To the east you can make out a shrine built into the wall.
