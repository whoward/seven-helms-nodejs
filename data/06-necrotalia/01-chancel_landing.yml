description: >
   You are now standing at the base of the lift, above you is a long shaft which
   the lift descended from.  This seems to be the base of the elevator, it seems
   impossible to force the lift to return to the top level.  You can not easily 
   see the area around you because it is too dark.  There is a small chaos star 
   which seems to be burning in the middle of several pillars.

   To the north there is a dark passageway.
