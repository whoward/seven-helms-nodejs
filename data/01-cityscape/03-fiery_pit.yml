name: Fiery Pit
description: >
   You are standing at the precipice of the fiery pit, looking down into it you see a smooth stone bridge
   crossing the gap of the fiery pit about 10 metres down.  The pit continues down for several metres further
   and ends in a solid surface which burns with unnatural fires.  If you are careful you should 
   be able to descend down the pit wall to the bridge.
